1. PHR System Implementation<br/>
Description:<br/>
•	A fully functional cloud-based Personal Health Record (PHR) system accessible via APIs.<br/>
•	Built using Python's built-in HTTP package for server-side communication.<br/>
•	Utilizes MySQL database for storing health records and user information.<br/>
Features:<br/>
•	CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing health records.<br/>
•	User authentication and authorization for accessing and managing health data securely.<br/>


3. Documentation<br/>
System Architecture:<br/>
•	Illustrates the architecture of the PHR system, including microservices, database, and communication protocols.<br/>
Design Decisions:<br/>
•	Discusses the rationale behind technology choices, such as Python for server-side scripting and MySQL for data storage.<br/>
Agile Process:<br/>
•	Describes how agile methodologies, like Scrum or Kanban, were applied throughout the development lifecycle.<br/>
User Stories:<br/>
•	Provides a list of user stories that guided the development process, including user requirements and acceptance criteria.<br/>
API Documentation:<br/>
•	Details all APIs exposed by the system, including endpoints, request/response formats, and example API calls.<br/>
Security Measures:<br/>
•	Outlines the security measures implemented, such as authentication mechanisms, encryption, and data access controls.<br/>


4. Testing Suite<br/>
Functional Tests:<br/>
•	Includes a suite of automated tests covering functional requirements, ensuring that CRUD operations and API endpoints function correctly.<br/>
