•	Utilizes MySQL database for storing health records and user information.
Features:
•	CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing health records.
•	User authentication and authorization for accessing and managing health data securely.


2. Documentation
System Architecture:
•	Illustrates the architecture of the PHR system, including microservices, database, and communication protocols.
Design Decisions:
•	Discusses the rationale behind technology choices, such as Python for server-side scripting and MySQL for data storage.
